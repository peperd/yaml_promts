| NAME             | PROMT      | DESCRIPTION    |    EXAMPLE      |
|------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| app.yaml         |  create app.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0 with resource limits | This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment named app, which ensures that one replica of the specified container image (gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0) is running at all times. The container is configured with resource requests and limits for CPU and memory. The Deployment and Pods created by it are labeled with app: app for identification and management purposes | ![app.yaml](yaml/app.yaml) |
| app-livenessProbe.yaml | create app-livenessProbe.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0  with resources | It is used to deploy a containerized application with liveness and readiness probes configured. The deployment ensures the application is running properly by periodically checking its health status. | ![app-livenessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| app-readinessProbe.yaml | create app-readinessProbe.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0  with resources | The readiness probe periodically checks the application's health status by sending an HTTP GET request to /healthz on port 8080. The probe starts after an initial delay of 5 seconds and repeats every 10 seconds. It has a timeout of 5 seconds and requires at least one successful check for the pod to be considered ready | ![app-livenessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| app-volumeMounts.yaml | create app-volumeMounts.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0  with resources | The volume mount named "data" is mounted at the path "/app/data" within the container. The volume is sourced from a ConfigMap named "app-data-configmap" | ![app-volumeMounts.yaml](yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| app-cronjob.yaml | create app-cronjob.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0  with resources | CronJob is running every 5 minutes, and contains a job template specifying a container named "mycontainer" with resource requests and limits for CPU and memory. The restart policy is set to "OnFailure" | ![app-cronjob.yaml](yaml/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| app-job.yaml | create app-job.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0   | This job runs a single pod. The pod contains a container named "app-container" with a specified image. The restart policy is set to "OnFailure", and it has a backoff limit of 4 | ![app-job.yaml](yaml/app-job.yaml) |
| app-multicontainer.yaml | create app-multicontainer.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0 with resources and volumeMounts | This yaml includes a pod template with a container named "container" running the specified image. Resource limits and requests are set for CPU and memory. Additionally, it defines a volume mount named "volume" at the path "/data" within the container and creates an emptyDir volume named "volume" | ![app-multicontainer.yaml](yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| app-resources.yaml | create app-resources.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0 with resource limits | This YAML defines a Deployment named "app-name" with one replica, running a container named "app-name" with resource limits set to 1 CPU and 1Gi memory. It exposes port 8080, with readiness and liveness probes checking the health of the container | ![app-resources.yaml](yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| app-secret-env.yaml | create app-secret-env.yaml for gcr.io/tetris-effect-419120/k8s-k3s:v2.0.0 with containers and volumes and resource limits | This YAML describes a Pod named "app-secret-env" running a container called "app-secret-env-container" with resource limits set to 1 CPU and 512Mi memory. It mounts a secret named "app-secret" to the path "/app/secret" within the container | ![app-secret-env.yaml](yaml/app-secret-env.yaml) |
